<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Why?** I wanted to sharpen my DOM understanding and manipulation skills with vanilla javascript. I've also always wanted to learn what goes into making a chrome extension so I made this one that replaces every image with a puppy and every header with a motivational quote.

**TL;DR** In a world where we are constantly solicited by angering or saddening news, we could all use a little more serotonin.
